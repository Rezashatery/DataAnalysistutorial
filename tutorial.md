## Visualization

**Bar charts** are great for comparing numerical values to each other, but not for comparing values to the total. A bar chart allows for easy comparison between categories by comparing the height of bars on the chart. 

**Pie charts** are best for comparing values in each category to the total.

## Combine Variables

A single variable, like the number of cafes in a state, is not always very useful.

We'll consider multiple variables at once with scatter plots and table operations to make more meaningful comparisons.

**scatter plot** shows us that states with more people tend to have more Starbucks Cafes. A scatter plot is one way to make a fairer comparison of Starbucks' popularity between states of different populations. scatter plots are used for viewing the relationship between two variables.

PS: Combining data across multiple table columns can help to make comparisons more meaningful.

Consumers can be described by **categorical variables**, like gender, and **continuous variables**, like their age or income.

**Histograms** are a useful tool for examining continuous variables. When we group a variable into ranges, the ranges should be the same width — this turns our bar chart into a histogram.Narrower bins show a more detailed picture of the data, but small numbers in each bin cause more random variation in bin height.

PS: If you were selling a new product to existing Starbucks customers, A reasonable aim would be to target the median age, or 50th percentile — the age that is greater than 50% of customers.

PS: A bar chart is the best choice for comparing categorical variables. Pie charts are good for seeing a quantity as a proportion of the total, while histograms are used for continuous variables. 

The range from the 25th to 75th percentile is known as the **Interquartile Range**.

**Line graphs** are a good way to compare how values change over time. A cafe chain, for example, could use them to see which cafes are busiest at which times of day.With lines instead of bars we can easily view and compare data.

**Filtering** is performed using **logical expressions** — statements that are either true or false. Only rows for which the logical expression is true are kept.

These logical expressions have three parts: the column name, the relationship, and the value. Filters can be combined in order to look at different segments of the data. Logical expressions are combined using logical operators like AND and OR.
