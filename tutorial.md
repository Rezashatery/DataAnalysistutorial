## Visualization

**Bar charts** are great for comparing numerical values to each other, but not for comparing values to the total. A bar chart allows for easy comparison between categories by comparing the height of bars on the chart. 

**Pie charts** are best for comparing values in each category to the total.

## Combine Variables

A single variable, like the number of cafes in a state, is not always very useful.

We'll consider multiple variables at once with scatter plots and table operations to make more meaningful comparisons.

**scatter plot** shows us that states with more people tend to have more Starbucks Cafes. A scatter plot is one way to make a fairer comparison of Starbucks' popularity between states of different populations. scatter plots are used for viewing the relationship between two variables.

PS: Combining data across multiple table columns can help to make comparisons more meaningful.

Consumers can be described by **categorical variables**, like gender, and **continuous variables**, like their age or income.

**Histograms** are a useful tool for examining continuous variables. When we group a variable into ranges, the ranges should be the same width — this turns our bar chart into a histogram.Narrower bins show a more detailed picture of the data, but small numbers in each bin cause more random variation in bin height.

PS: If you were selling a new product to existing Starbucks customers, A reasonable aim would be to target the median age, or 50th percentile — the age that is greater than 50% of customers.
