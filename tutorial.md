**Data analysis** is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It is a crucial step in data-driven industries, enabling businesses and organizations to make sense of raw data and turn it into actionable insights.

## Visualization

**Bar charts** are great for comparing numerical values to each other, but not for comparing values to the total. A bar chart allows for easy comparison between categories by comparing the height of bars on the chart. 

**Pie charts** are best for comparing values in each category to the total.

## Combine Variables

A single variable, like the number of cafes in a state, is not always very useful.

We'll consider multiple variables at once with scatter plots and table operations to make more meaningful comparisons.

**scatter plot** shows us that states with more people tend to have more Starbucks Cafes. A scatter plot is one way to make a fairer comparison of Starbucks' popularity between states of different populations. scatter plots are used for viewing the relationship between two variables.

PS: Combining data across multiple table columns can help to make comparisons more meaningful.

Consumers can be described by **categorical variables**, like gender, and **continuous variables**, like their age or income.

**Histograms** are a useful tool for examining continuous variables. When we group a variable into ranges, the ranges should be the same width — this turns our bar chart into a histogram.Narrower bins show a more detailed picture of the data, but small numbers in each bin cause more random variation in bin height. A histogram is best for a single continuous variable like the rental rate.

PS: If you were selling a new product to existing Starbucks customers, A reasonable aim would be to target the median age, or 50th percentile — the age that is greater than 50% of customers.

PS: A bar chart is the best choice for comparing categorical variables. Pie charts are good for seeing a quantity as a proportion of the total, while histograms are used for continuous variables. 

The range from the 25th to 75th percentile is known as the **Interquartile Range**.

**Line graphs** are a good way to compare how values change over time. A cafe chain, for example, could use them to see which cafes are busiest at which times of day.With lines instead of bars we can easily view and compare data.

**Filtering** is performed using **logical expressions** — statements that are either true or false. Only rows for which the logical expression is true are kept.

These logical expressions have three parts: the column name, the relationship, and the value. Filters can be combined in order to look at different segments of the data. Logical expressions are combined using logical operators like AND and OR. 

**Grouping**  is the process of organizing data into categories based on a specific attribute or variable. It helps in summarizing, analyzing, and drawing insights from large datasets by focusing on common characteristics.

On a **linear scale**, each unit corresponds to adding the same amount. On a **logarithmic scale**, each unit corresponds to multiplying by the same amount.

A base-10 **logarithm** tells us how many times we need to multiply 10 to get another number. For example, it takes 3 multiplications to get 1000 from 10, so log⁡(1000)=3.

A base-10 logarithm gives us roughly the number of digits in a number, or its order of magnitude. 

The **mode** is the most common value (or values) in a dataset.(the most common number that appears in the set of data)

 A visualization type useful for comparing multiple distributions is a box and whisker plot, or **boxplot**. In a boxplot, the middle line represents the median, and the ends of the 'whiskers' mark the minimum and maximum values.
 The box ranges from the 25th percentile of the data — called the lower quartile, or Q1— and the 75th percentile — called the upper quartile, or Q3​. **Boxplots** visually summarize the data — but their real power lies in the ease of comparisons between distributions.(the median was smaller than 5, means that at least half of the number is less than 5). Boxplots are best for comparing distributions of a continuous variable like revenue.

 An ordered sequence of values taken at equally spaced points in time is called a **time series**. A **trend** is the general, long-term pattern of a time series.

 PS: The most appropriate visualization is a plot that displays only the necessary information. 

 The four types of data in data analytics are:

**Nominal Data**: Categorical data without a specific order (e.g., gender, colors, names).
**Ordinal Data**: Categorical data with a defined order but no consistent difference between categories (e.g., rankings, satisfaction levels).
**Interval Data**: Numeric data with equal intervals between values, but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius, dates).
**Ratio Data**: Numeric data with equal intervals and a meaningful zero, allowing for comparisons of magnitudes (e.g., height, weight, age).

**Probability** lets us estimate the likelihood of an event based on the information available to us.
